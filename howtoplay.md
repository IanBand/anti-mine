## Game Objective

- In order to win, you must reveal all the tiles that do not contain a mine or an anti mine.
- The patterns of colors on the board give clues to the locations of mines and anti mines.
- By itself, a mine will brighten the surrounding safe tiles. Likewise, an anti mine will darken its surrounding safe tiles. Be careful, these two effects will cancel eachother out if a mine and anti mine are in close proximity! This is reffered to as two mines annihilating eachother.
